# Blue Bikes Station Demand Prediction
## Description
This project will predict the number of bike trips starting from Boston Blue Bikes stations on any given date using historical usage patterns, weather conditions, and time/date based factors. The goal is to create a practical forecasting tool that could help users plan bike trips and assist the Blue Bikes system with resource allocation decisions. Personally, I have found myself in numerous situations where I would have planned a trip the night before based off the assumption that there would be blue bikes available at the nearest station, only to wake up the next morning to find out that there were in fact no blue bikes available, which always infuriated me.
## Goal
Predict how busy each Blue Bikes station will be on any given date (measured by number of trips starting from that station) using the following factors: time patterns, weather, location, station characteristics, special dates, days of the week, etc. Potentially have the option to separately predict between E-bike trips and Classic bike trips.
## What Data Needs to be Collected and How I Will Collect It
Historical trip data will be downloaded from the Blue Bikes system data portal (https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data) covering post-COVID (2022-2025) years of ride records with start/end stations, timestamps, and bike types. These trip records are all very large csv files. Station information including locations, capacity, and city/town name will also be collected from the same portal, also in the form of csv files. Weather data will be collected using the OpenWeatherMap API for corresponding time periods, including temperature, precipitation, and weather conditions. Temporal features will be extracted from Boston University academic calendars and federal holiday schedules to capture usage pattern variations. Collecting the data seems to be the less time consuming part, whereas cleaning it seems like it would take a long while due to the sheer amount.
## How I Plan on Modeling the Data
I'm thinking a good start would be using XGBoost regression as the primary approach, since it handles mixed data types well and is commonly used for prediction tasks with tabular data. Alternative regression methods may be explored as we learn additional techniques in class. Features will include temporal variables (day of week, holidays), weather conditions (temperature, rain/no rain), and station location characteristics (capacity, neighborhood type, proximity to transit).
## How I Plan on Visualizing the Data
Visualizations will include scatter plots showing relationships between key features and trip demand, and heat maps displaying predicted demand patterns across stations and time periods. As a final product, I also want to have an interactive one page web app that will display a map of Boston with clickable Blue Bikes stations where users can select a station and future date to see predicted trip demand. 
## What is My Test Plan
The model will be trained on historical data from 2022-2024 and tested on 2025 data to ensure it can predict future trip patterns. Will compare the predicted results for each datapoint to the actual results to determine accuracy.
